                Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like and copy human actions.
                <br>
                <br>
                The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
                <br>
                <br>
                The goals of artificial intelligence include computer-enhanced learning, reasoning, and perception.
                <br>
                <br>
                AI is being used today across different industries from finance to healthcare.
                <br>
                <br>
                Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex and human-like.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some critics fear that the extensive use of advanced AI can have a negative effect on society.

            <div class="sub-texts">
                We’ve come a long way as a society. It was just 1970 when Marvin Minsky, a talented cognitive scientist, once believed that, “in three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of a human being”. 52 years later we have the privilege of knowing that isn’t the case; technology is nowhere near the intelligence of a human, but that isn’t to say AI hasn’t evolved greatly over the years. 
                <br>
                <br>
                First described in 1950, the idea of inanimate objects coming to life as intelligent human beings was around for a long time. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Beginnings of modern AI can be traced to classical philosophers' attempts to describe human thinking as a symbolic system.
                <br>
                <br>
                The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College, during the summer of 1956
                <br><br>
                Now that AI systems are capable of analyzing complex algorithms and self-learning, we enter a new age in medicine where AI can be applied to clinical practice through risk assessment models, improving diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency.
                <br><br>
                The earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the British logician and computer pioneer Alan Mathison Turing.

            Uses of AI
        </div>
        <div class="section-four-text">
            AI is used all over the real world, sometimes while we aren’t even paying attention. 
            <br><br>
            <b><a href="https://verloop.io/wp-content/uploads/How-Does-Voice-AI-Work-Infographics-1024x512.jpg">Voice assistants:</a></b>  Have you ever used a Google Home, Google Maps or Siri? Well all of these are examples of a voice assistants AI being used around you. The main purpose of voice assistants is to be able to detect and understand humans in various languages, and then respond accordingly. For a voice assistant to work effectively, there needs to be a combination of automation and AI, and a 7 step process is used is: Human speech, voice to text conversion, drain background, process data with networks, get AI to understand what the user wants, evaluate response for an answer, and communicate back with the user). 
            <br><br>
            Without AI analyzing the speech, you would be able to convert speech for the computer but unable to deliver the response needed due to the computer being unable to understand the command. The AI in voice commands is what actually allows a computer to decipher the input “Closest pizza location” and figure out that the computer must search the web for the closest pizza locations and report it back to the user for example. 
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPxnIix5ExI"><b>Recommendations:</b></a> Whether you’re on Youtube, Spotify, or just scrolling through articles, AI has an effect on what you see and read. Everyone has their own preferences, so how can a program make its contents appealing to every user it has? The answer is a special filter using AI. Over time as you use a specific platform more (youtube for example), the platform will collect data on your previous searches to create a “portfolio” of what things you like. Then the next time the program is reloaded, the AI uses the previous data collected to recommend you content, whether it be videos or news articles that are more likely to peak your interest.
            <br><br>
            <b>NPCs and gaming:</b> It can also be understated how much of an impact AI has in the world of gaming as well. AI is essential for creating other characters, enemies, for the user to interact with, and depending on the depth of the AI, different computer-run characters can act differently depending on the situation around them. For example, if a computer controlled character called Jim is fighting the player, then if the player is standing at “x” distance, then Jim can decide to use a ranged weapon or a melee weapon. At the same time if the player approaches with a light weapon, then Jim can use AI to counter-pick the user’s current weapon with a heavier weapon. A last example with AI is if Jim knows that the user is in the area but can’t detect where they are at the moment, Jim can decide what cycles he could take to look for player, and if the AI is developed enough, it can decide whether account for sound effects, and travel towards it, or take traps into considerations and approach with caution.

            How will AI Affect the Future
        </div>
            <div class = "ugh">
            <div class="section-four-text">
                AI is an ever expanding technological field, and will only grow as an industry and develop in the years to come. 
                <br><br>
                Transportation: Many car companies are already looking for ways to make driving safer and more automated for everyone everyday by creating self driving cars. Cars already have the sensors to detect the various lines and cars around it, so with a fully functional AI to communicate with other cars while being able to access the area around it, it will give people commuting a safer and more comfortable ride to their destinations every day. 
                <br><br>
                Healthcare: Healthcare is a very important part of our society, and when it comes to a life or death situation, getting quick and effective service is a must. However humans all have limits as we have seen throughout the COVID-19 paramedic, which is why AI in healthcare is becoming increasingly important, and will continue to be in the future. With the use of AI in hospitals and clinics, AI can deliver treatments on quick notice, perform repetitive tasks quick such as entering client data and conditions, and even when the technology and AI advancements are great enough, AI may even be able to take over critical surgeries, as machines can be a lot more precise than human hands when removing something like a gunshot from a brain for example. 
                <br><br>
                Manufacturing: Machinery is already a big part of the manufacturing business, but AI could grow into a major part of the industry too. While machinery can mainly be used to create and package items at a stationary location, with the help of AI new machinery can also be made to transport loads to various locations around  a facility, or onto trucks completely automated. This would reduce the amount of labor an average worker would have to do throughout a day, and it would also be more efficient timewise. 
                <br><br>
                In the future, AI may realistically take up more  human jobs, but it would also make the workplaces utilized in more cost and time efficient for companies. It means that humans can end up receiving the short end of the stick with this current rate of development, even if overall processes and development of AI improve these various areas.
